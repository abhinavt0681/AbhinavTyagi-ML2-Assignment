# **Advanced Regression Assignment**


Surprise Housing, a real estate firm based in the United States, has made the decision to expand into the Australian market. To assist with this venture, the company has gathered a dataset of house sales in Australia and is using data analytics to identify properties that can be purchased at a lower price and then resold for a profit. In order to effectively evaluate potential investments, the company has tasked you with creating a regression model that utilizes regularization techniques to accurately predict the value of these properties. The model will also allow the company to determine which variables are most significant in influencing the price of a house and to gauge the effectiveness.
